The *point spread function* (*PSF*) describes the response of an imaging

point object. A more general term for the PSF is a system's impulse
response <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impulse_response>, the PSF being
the impulse response of a /focused/ optical system. The PSF in many
contexts can be thought of as the extended blob in an image that
represents an unresolved object. In functional terms it is the spatial
domain

version of the transfer function of the imaging system
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_transfer_function>. It is a
useful concept in Fourier optics

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confocal_laser_scanning_microscopy>) and
fluorescence microscopy
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence_microscopy>. The degree of
spreading (blurring) of the point object is a measure for the quality of
an imaging system. In non-coherent
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)> imaging systems such
as fluorescent <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescent> microscopes
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopes>, telescopes
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telescopes> or optical microscopes, the
image formation process is linear in power and described by linear
system <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_system> theory. This means
that when two objects A and B are imaged simultaneously, the result is
equal to the sum of the independently imaged objects. In other words:
the imaging of A is unaffected by the imaging of B and /vice versa/,
owing to the non-interacting property of photons. The image of a complex
object can then be seen as a convolution
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution> of the true object and the
PSF. However, when the detected light is coherent
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)>, image formation is
linear in the complex <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number>
field <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_field>. Recording the
intensity image then can lead to cancellations or other non-linear effects.

    Introduction[edit
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Point_spread_function&action=edit&section=1>]

By virtue of the linearity property of optical imaging systems, i.e.,

    /Image/(/Object/_1 + /Object/_2 ) = /Image/(/Object/_1 ) +
    /Image/(/Object/_2 )

the image of an object in a microscope or telescope can be computed by
expressing the object-plane field as a weighted sum over 2D impulse
functions, and then expressing the image plane field as the weighted sum
over the /images/ of these impulse functions. This is known as the
/superposition principle/, valid for linear systems
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_systems>. The images of the
individual object-plane impulse functions are called point spread
functions, reflecting the fact that a mathematical /point/ of light in
the object plane is /spread/ out to form a finite area in the image
plane (in some branches of mathematics and physics, these might be
referred to as Green's functions
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green%27s_functions> or impulse response
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impulse_response> functions).

When the object is divided into discrete point objects of varying
intensity, the image is computed as a sum of the PSF of each point. As
the PSF is typically determined entirely by the imaging system (that is,
microscope or telescope), the entire image can be described by knowing
the optical properties of the system. This process is usually formulated
by a convolution <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution> equation.
In microscope image processing
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope_image_processing> and
astronomy <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy>, knowing the PSF of
the measuring device is very important for restoring the (original)
image with deconvolution <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deconvolution>.


    Theory[edit
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Point_spread_function&action=edit&section=2>]

The point spread function may be independent of position in the object
plane, in which case it is called /shift invariant/. In addition, if
there is no distortion in the system, the image plane coordinates are
linearly related to the object plane coordinates via the magnification
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnification> /M/ as:

    (x_i, y_i) = (M x_o, M y_o).

If the imaging system produces an inverted image, we may simply regard
the image plane coordinate axes as being reversed from the object plane
axes. With these two assumptions, i.e., that the PSF is shift-invariant
/and/ that there is no distortion, calculating the image plane
convolution integral is a straightforward process.

Mathematically, we may represent the object plane field as:

    O(x_o,y_o) = \int\!\!\int O(u,v) ~ \delta(u-x_o,v-y_o) ~ du\, dv

i.e., as a sum over weighted impulse functions, although this is also
really just stating the sifting property of 2D delta functions
(discussed further below). Rewriting the object transmittance function
in the form above allows us to calculate the image plane field as the
superposition of the images of each of the individual impulse functions,
i.e., as a superposition over weighted point spread functions in the
image plane using the /same/ weighting function as in the object plane,
i.e., O(x_o,y_o). Mathematically, the image is expressed as:

    I(x_i,y_i) = \int\!\!\int O(u,v) ~ \mathrm{PSF}(u-x_i/M , v-y_i/M)
    \, du\, dv

in which PSF(/u/ −  /x_i /M/, /v/  −  /y_i /M/) is the image of the
impulse function δ(/u/  −  /x_o /, /v/  −  /y_o /).

The 2D impulse function may be regarded as the limit (as side dimension
/w/ tends to zero) of the "square post" function, shown in the figure below.

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:SquarePost.svg>

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:SquarePost.svg>
Square Post Function

We imagine the object plane as being decomposed into square areas such
as this, with each having its own associated square post function. If
the height, /h/, of the post is maintained at 1/w^2 , then as the side
dimension /w/ tends to zero, the height, /h/, tends to infinity in such
a way that the volume (integral) remains constant at 1. This gives the
2D impulse the sifting property (which is implied in the equation
above), which says that when the 2D impulse function,
δ(/x/ − /u/,/y/ − /v/), is integrated against any other continuous
function, /f/(/u/,/v/), it "sifts out" the value of /f/ at the location
of the impulse, /i/./e/., at the point (/x/,/y/).

Since the concept of a perfect point source object is so central to the
idea of PSF, it's worth spending some time on that before proceeding
further. First of all, there is no such thing in nature as a perfect
mathematical point source radiator; the concept is completely
non-physical and is nothing more than a mathematical construct used to
model and understand optical imaging systems. The utility of the point
source concept comes from the fact that a point source in the 2D object
plane can only radiate a perfect uniform-amplitude, spherical wave — a
wave having perfectly spherical, outward travelling phase fronts with
uniform intensity everywhere on the spheres (see Huygens–Fresnel
principle
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huygens%E2%80%93Fresnel_principle>). Such
a source of uniform spherical waves is shown in the figure below. We
also note that a perfect point source radiator will not only radiate a
uniform spectrum of propagating plane waves, but a uniform spectrum of
exponentially decaying (evanescent
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evanescent_wave>) waves as well, and it
is these which are responsible for resolution finer than one wavelength
(see Fourier optics <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_optics>).
This follows from the following Fourier transform
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform> expression for a 2D
impulse function,

    \delta (x,y) \propto \int\!\!\int e^{j(k_x x + k_y y)} \, d k_x\, d k_y

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:PSF.svg>

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:PSF.svg>
Truncation of Spherical Wave by Lens

The quadratic lens <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(optics)>
intercepts a /portion/ of this spherical wave, and refocuses it onto a
blurred point in the image plane. For a single lens
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(optics)>, an on-axis point source
in the object plane produces an Airy disc
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airy_disc> PSF in the image plane. This
comes about in the following way. /It can be shown/ (see Fourier optics
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_optics>, Huygens–Fresnel
principle
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huygens%E2%80%93Fresnel_principle>,
Fraunhofer diffraction
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraunhofer_diffraction>) that the field
radiated by a planar object (or, by reciprocity, the field converging
onto a planar image) is related to its corresponding source (or image)
plane distribution via a Fourier transform
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform> (FT) relation. In
addition, a uniform function over a circular area (in one FT domain)
corresponds to the Airy function, /J/_1 (/x/)//x/ in the other FT
domain, where /J/_1 (/x/) is the first-order Bessel function
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bessel_function> of the first kind. That
is, a uniformly-illuminated circular aperture that passes a converging
uniform spherical wave yields an Airy function image at the focal plane.
A graph of a sample 2D Airy function is shown in the adjoining figure.

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Airy-3d.svg>

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Airy-3d.svg>
Airy Function

Therefore, the converging (/partial/) spherical wave shown in the figure
above produces an Airy disc <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airy_disc> in
the image plane. The argument of the Airy function is important, because
this determines the /scaling/ of the Airy disc (in other words, how big
the disc is in the image plane). If Θ_max is the maximum angle that the
converging waves make with the lens axis, /r/ is radial distance in the
image plane, and wavenumber <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavenumber>
/k/ = 2π/λ where λ = wavelength, then the argument of the Airy function
is: kr tan(Θ_max ). If Θ_max is small (only a small portion of the
converging spherical wave is available to form the image), then radial
distance, r, has to be very large before the total argument of the Airy
function moves away from the central spot. In other words, if Θ_max is
small, the Airy disc is large (which is just another statement of
Heisenberg's uncertainty principle
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle> for FT pairs,
namely that small extent in one domain corresponds to wide extent in the
other domain, and the two are related via the /space-bandwidth
product/). By virtue of this, high magnification
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnification> systems, which typically
have small values of Θ_max (by the Abbe sine condition
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbe_sine_condition>), can have more blur
in the image, owing to the broader PSF. The size of the PSF is
proportional to the magnification
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnification>, so that the blur is no
worse in a relative sense, but it is definitely worse in an absolute sense.

In the figure above, illustrating the truncation of the incident
spherical wave by the lens, we may note one very significant fact. In
order to measure the point spread function — or impulse response
function — of the lens, we do not need a perfect point source that
radiates a perfect spherical wave in all directions of space. This is
because our lens has only a finite (angular) bandwidth, or finite
intercept angle. Therefore any angular bandwidth contained in the
source, which extends past the edge angle of the lens (i.e., lies
outside the bandwidth of the system), is essentially wasted source
bandwidth because the lens can't intercept it in order to process it. As
a result, a perfect point source is not required in order to measure a
perfect point spread function. All we need is a light source which has
at least as much angular bandwidth as the lens being tested (and of
course, is uniform over that angular sector). In other words, we only
require a point source which is produced by a convergent (uniform)
spherical wave whose half angle is greater than the edge angle of the lens.


    History and methods[edit
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Point_spread_function&action=edit&section=3>]

The diffraction theory of point-spread functions was first studied by
Airy <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Biddell_Airy> in the
nineteenth century. He developed an expression for the point-spread
function amplitude and intensity of a perfect instrument, free of
aberrations (the so-called Airy disc
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airy_disc>). The theory of aberrated
point-spread functions close to the optimum focal plane was studied by
the Dutch physicists Frits Zernike
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frits_Zernike> and Nijboer in the
1930–40s. A central role in their analysis is played by Zernike's
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frits_Zernike> circle polynomials
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zernike_polynomials> that allow an
efficient representation of the aberrations of any optical system with
rotational symmetry. Recent analytic results have made it possible to
extend Nijboer and Zernike's approach for point-spread function
evaluation to a large volume around the optimum focal point. This
extended Nijboer-Zernike (ENZ) theory is instrumental in studying the
imperfect imaging of three-dimensional objects in confocal microscopy
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confocal_microscopy> or astronomy under
non-ideal imaging conditions. The ENZ-theory has also been applied to
the characterization of optical instruments with respect to their
aberration by measuring the through-focus intensity distribution and
solving an appropriate inverse problem
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_problem>.


    PSF in microscopy[edit
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Point_spread_function&action=edit&section=4>]

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:63x_1.4NA_Confocal_Point_Spread_Function_2%2B3D.png>


<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:63x_1.4NA_Confocal_Point_Spread_Function_2%2B3D.png>
An example of an experimentally derived point spread function from a
confocal microscope using a 63x 1.4NA oil objective. It was generated
using Huygens Professional deconvolution software. Shown are views in
xz, xy, yz and a 3D representation.

In microscopy, experimental determination of PSF requires sub-resolution
(point-like) radiating sources. quantum dots
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_dot> and fluorescent
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescent> beads
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bead> are usually considered for this
purpose.^[1] <#cite_note-1> ^[2] <#cite_note-2> Theoretical models as
described above, on the other hand, allow the detailed calculation of
the PSF for various imaging conditions. The most compact diffraction
limited <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffraction_limited> shape of the
PSF is usually preferred. However by using appropriate optical elements
(e.g., a spatial light modulator
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_light_modulator>) the shape of
the PSF can be engineered towards different applications.


    The PSF in astronomy[edit

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Space_Telescope>'s WFPC
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_Field_and_Planetary_Camera> camera
before corrections were applied to its optical system.

In observational astronomy
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_astronomy> the experimental
determination of a PSF is often very straightforward due to the ample
supply of point sources (stars <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star> or
quasars <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasars>). The form and source of
the PSF may vary widely depending on the instrument and the context in
which it is used.

For radio telescopes <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_telescopes>
and diffraction-limited
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffraction-limited_system> space
telescopes <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telescopes> the dominant terms
in the PSF may be inferred from the configuration of the aperture in the
Fourier domain <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_domain>. In
practice there may be multiple terms contributed by the various
components in a complex optical system. A complete description of the
PSF will also include diffusion of light (or photo-electrons) in the
detector, as well as tracking
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attitude_control> errors in the
spacecraft or telescope.

For ground based optical telescopes, atmospheric turbulence (known as
astronomical seeing <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_seeing>)
dominates the contribution to the PSF. In high-resolution ground-based
imaging, the PSF is often found to vary with position in the image (an
effect called anisoplanatism). In ground based adaptive optics
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_optics> systems the PSF is a
combination of the aperture of the system with residual uncorrected
atmospheric terms.


    Point spread functions in ophthalmology[edit

PSFs have recently become a useful diagnostic tool in clinical
ophthalmology <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophthalmology>. Patients
are measured with a wavefront <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront>
sensor, and special software calculates the PSF for that patient's eye.
In this manner a physician can "see" what the patient sees. This method
also allows a physician to simulate potential treatments on a patient,
and see how those treatments would alter the patient's PSF.
Additionally, once measured the PSF can be minimized using an adaptive
optics system. This, in conjunction with a CCD, can be used to visualize
anatomical structures not otherwise visible /in vivo/, such as cone
photoreceptors.
